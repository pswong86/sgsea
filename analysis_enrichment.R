# Code for serialized gene set enrichment analysis

# Load expression data ----------------------------------------------------

# assuming that the fold change data has been calculated between two groups
# assuming that the fold change data is in the form like this:
# gene_id     | Time1 | Time2 | Time3  ...
# g1          | 
# g2          |
# g3          |
# g4          |
# g5          |

# Load test set/s ---------------------------------------------------------
# assuming that there are groups of genes you want to test
# assuming the gene ids are the same as expression data, load them into a (R) character vector
